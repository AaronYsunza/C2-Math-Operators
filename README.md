## Math Operators
Used to perform mathematical operations, __(AKA. Arithemetic Operations)__

1. Addition, `+`
2. Subtraction, `-`
3. Multiplication, `*`
4. Division, `/` (Exact Answer, float)
   Division, `//` (Quotient, integer)
5. Modulo, `%` (Remainder)
6. Exponents , `**` 

*Ex.*
 `print(2+1)`
 > 3
`print(5 % 3)`
 > 2
`print(2 ** 3)`
 > 8

## Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables

0. Simple Assignment `=`
1. Addition Assignment `+=`
2. Subtract Assignment `-=`
3. Multiply Assignment `*=`
4. Divide Assignment `/=`
   Divide Assignment `//=`
5. Modulo Assignment `%=`
6. Exponent Assignment `**=`

### Rule for using Assignment Operators
A variable must be declared before using an assignment operator with variable

*Ex.*
```
a = 5
a += 2 # euqivalent to a = a + 2
print(a)
```
